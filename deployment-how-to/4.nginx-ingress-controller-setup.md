First we need to install an ingress controller that must run inside the kubernetes cluster in order for the ingress resources to work. This controller will interpret the rules that we define inside an ingress resource.  
In order to deploy the nginx controler I have created the manifest [nicolae-demo-app-nginx-controller.yaml](nicolae-demo-app-nginx-controller.yaml) where the nginx controller deployment is defind and the asociated service accounts with rbac policies.  
To apply it run the following command $ kubectl apply -f nicolae-demo-app-nginx-controller.yaml  

Once the nginx conroller pods and services have started we can deploy the ingress routes that are define in the file [nicolae-demo-app-ingress-routes.yaml](nicolae-demo-app-ingress-routes.yaml)
