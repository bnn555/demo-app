1. Connect using ssh to the already created and configured clientVM
2. Login to azure with the command: $ az login
3. Export kubctl env with command: $ export KUBECONFIG=~/_output/nicolae-demo-app/kubeconfig/kubeconfig.westeurope.json

For the deployment of the pods I have created the yaml file: [nicolae-demo-app-deployment.yaml](nicolae-demo-app-deployment.yaml)  
Inside we can see the definition of the Deployments for both services we want to deploy: service-a-deployment and service-a-deployment, both are exposing the same port 8080 with the same name (http-web-svc) that can be used inside the service definition, also there we have the definition of the namespace that we are going to use for this demo project: ns-demo-app.
