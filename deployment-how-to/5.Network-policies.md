By default, Kubernetes allows unconstrained communication between services.
In order to block this access we must enforce network policies.
In the yaml file [nicolae-demo-app-network-policies.yam](nicolae-demo-app-network-policies) I have created a network policy for each pod that has the label **service-a-app** or **service-b-app** to accept only ingress traffic from the ingress service deployed in the namespace **ns-demo-app**.
